# Mood-based-Music-Recommender
Mood Based music recommender is a Python-based web application that detects your mood using a webcam and plays a song that matches your mood. It uses facial recognition and brightness heuristics to determine emotions like **happy**, **sad**, **energetic**, **calm**, and **angry**.
